## Introduction

Have you ever contemplated why stars exist? Or were they simply the consequences of the Big Bang? In this blog, I am going to discuss the life cycle of a star, tales of hundreds of billions of stars from their birth till their death.

## About

### Early Universe
Around 14 billion years ago, it is assumed that Big Bang took place. As a result of which the matter that was once condensed, spread out due to a blast, which we know as the starting point of the Universe. Moreover, our Universe is still expanding continuously. When the blast had taken place the matter in our Universe was in a very high-energy unstable state and the overall temperature of the Universe was very high at that moment. As time passed by, the matter cooled down and started to ionize to form dust clouds. Such cosmic dust particles mainly consisted of protons and electrons at the very beginning. Afterward, protons and electrons combined to form Hydrogen (deuterium) atoms with relative ease, and so did the other elements. Still, Hydrogen is very abundant in the Universe since it only consisted of an electron and a proton moreover, it was the first element known to have come into existence, according to our observations of the Universe.

## Conclusion

***"The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of star-stuff." - Carl Sagan (renowned American Astronomer)***

It is really stimulating to know that humans are a product of star ash. Every time it amazes me to know how vast the Universe is and how little humans know about the truth of this Universe. This feeling motivates most Astronomers and Astrophysicists to keep trying and unfold the mysteries of our Universe.
