## Introduction

Have you ever heard a phrase stating: "Akal badi ya bhains?"

Translated: "Should strength be given priority or mind?" 

And the obvious answer is that our mind is far superior to strength. On the other hand, there are one more phrase states - "In front of absolute power, no mind games are strong enough to beat it".
I would say that we cannot define absolute power on the basis of strength alone. how to use that strength in the presence of mind is the best way to define absolute strength. Strategizing and playing mind games is also an essential part of Game Theory.
In this blog, I am going to present my thoughts on Game Theory with respect to a story from Hindu Mythology, which is considered to be the mother of all wars, mind games, and the embodiment of all feuds - Mahabharata.

## Insight on Mahabharata

Mahabharata was a war between cousin brothers (princes of Hastinapur Kingdom) over the crown. On one side there were Pandavas, named after their father Pandu (5 blood-related brothers) who were very potent and have always followed truth and justice. Kauravas (100 blood-related brothers) were fighting from the opposition. Dhritarashtra, who was blind since birth, was the father of Kauravas and he was appointed as a king instead of to Pandu. Pandu and Dhritrashtra are blood-related brothers, which makes Pandavas and Kauravas cousins.

A tradition is followed since ages ago in the kingdom, where the throne will be passed on to the elder brother who was capable of leading a nation. Following this tradition, Yudhishtira, the eldest brother among Pandavas was going to inherit the throne but Dhritrashtra and his sons were at odds with this. They wanted Duryodhan, eldest brother among Kauravas to inherit the throne of Hastinapur. Shakuni (Maternal uncle of Kauravas), who was a very good strategist, was helping Kauravas in their plan to get rid of Pandavas via deception.

Pandavas were participating in this war with a backing of 7 lakh warriors, However, Kauravas were backed by 11 lakh warriors. Furthermore, they were supported by the three greatest warriors of the era, namely Bhishma (Great grandfather of Pandavas and Kauravas), Dronacharya (Teacher of Pandavas and Kauravas), and Karana (unfilial son of Kunti, mother of Pandavas).

Pandavas were supported by Lord Krishna (reincarnation of God Vishnu), who was participating as a charioteer (sarthi). Lord Krishna, was trying to teach humans a lesson by this war that in a fight between equity and iniquity, equity always prevails no matter how dire situations one may face. This war was not only restrained to the Hastinapur Kingdom but the whole continent was participating from either side.

## Game Theory in Mahabharata

It can be easily concluded that Pandavas were at loss, as they were short of 4 lakh warriors on their behalf moreover, Kauravas were supported by the three greatest warriors of the era. But as I stated in the introduction only strength is not enough to make you win a game or a battle. Lord Krishna was participating in the battle as a charioteer, thus he was involved with making strategies.

### Death of Bhishma
Bhishma (great grandfather of Pandavas and Kauravas), was a very powerful warrior and was blessed that he can die only when he desires to die, which made him a strong opponent. Lord Krishna brought, Shikhandi, Bhishma's fated rival to whom Bhishma swore to abandon his weapons once he face his rival in a battle. Later, Bhishma was made to sleep on the bed of arrows so that he would be in no position to fight any further.

### Death of Dronacharya
Dronacharya was the Teacher of Pandavas and Kauravas and the father of Ashwathama. Dronacharya loved his son dearly and his son was participating in the war. To defeat Dronacharya, his son was needed to be executed. On the other hand, Ashwathama was well protected and it was almost impossible to defeat him. So, Lord Krishna suggested naming an elephant Ashwathama and killing him. This incident created a false rumor on the battlefield that Ashwathama was dead. Due to this Dronacharya lost his motivation to fight as a result he was beheaded.

### Death of Karana
Karana was the disciple of Sage Parshuram, He deceived his teacher by saying that he belongs to a family of Priest. Later on, sage Parshuram got to know that Karana lied to him as consequence Karana was cursed to forget his knowledge at the most crucial moment of his life. To this Lord Krishna created such a situation where Karana was forced to forget his knowledge. Karana was also met with the same fate as the other two.

## Conclusion

Lord Krishna, instead of using an ounce of his strength strategized things and made it simpler for Pandavas to win the battle like he was scripting the battle. This is one of an epic example of Game Theory in battles.
