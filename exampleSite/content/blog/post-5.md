## Introduction

Have you ever wondered what if we can calculate the outcome of events that are going to take place shortly, or whether we are going to lose or win in a game that we haven’t played yet? Well, you just need to google ’Game Theory’ and you will get the answers to such questions since it is a branch of mathematics that is used to model the strategic reciprocity among competing players considering the predefined rules and outcomes. However, humans are not capable of high-speed calculations and predictions, and this is where the need for Artificial Intelligence arises. It works or should I say thinks, just like a normal human brain but faster. This blog will talk about Game Theory and Artificial Intelligence.

## Game Theory

Wikipedia says "Game Theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers". It is an emerging field that was often used by gamblers to increase their chances of winning. One can say this field is derived from gambling. According to me, Game Theory is predicting future events by calculating the degree of possibility of that particular event to take place surrounding the current situation. Moreover, in my personal opinion, people shouldn't feel anxiety from a person who has great strength instead of on should always stay alert in the vicinity of a person proficient in real-life Game Theory applications, for instance, one can co-relate to Lord Krishna, the master of Game Theory, and one can read about his life experiences from Mahabharata, a famous Hindi Literature. Another example can be found in the anime 'Death Note'. The mind games between Detective L (a.k.a L Lawliet) and Light Yagami is again a perfect example of how Game Theory can be inactuated in real life. We will talk in more detail about other Game Theory examples in the upcoming blogs.

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is intelligence illustrated by machines that are similar to animals including humans. We came up with the concept of AI---in order to make machines perform the same tasks as humans since we can make a machine work for as long as we require with a high success rate in comparison to human beings. And AI has only made life easier for humans. With advancements in technology, AI is evolving at a very faster rate.

In this age of advanced technological advancements, artificial intelligence is a tool that has become a necessity for modern-day industries and services. Almost all businesses are using AI since it reduces human efforts and produces more accurate results in due time. Moreover, the purpose of using AI across all domains is to produce better output and improve security levels. People are using home automation which is efficient, secure and the control of your house is at your fingertips. Another benefit of such systems is that they are very secure, as not everyone is adept with AI and automation systems and how they work, which makes it very difficult for a third party to interfere.

Looking at it from a bigger perspective people nowadays prefer to believe in AI in comparison to an individual as they are your personal never betraying assistants.

##  Interconnection b/w GT and AI

Game Theory is a relatively new field and works on various algorithms. Some researchers are still researching and working and studying new Game Theory algorithms and how we can incorporate Game Theory in new technologies specifically using AI as we all are aware of its advantages. Most algorithms are specific to certain tasks, an example of which is provided below. It is assumed that Quantum Computers are capable of predicting incidents going to occur in the near future accurately, thus making them sole candidates for Game Theory to be researched upon.

Also, Game Theory is vital for multi-agent AI programs where they need to compete amongst themselves to accomplish a goal. Other use of Game Theory can be reviewed through AI interactions in modern systems where Nash Equilibrium plays an important role.

A simple example of Game Theory in AI can be explained via an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game against an AI. It uses the Min-Max algorithm. Link to that code is given and understanding the algorithm via code is much easier.

## Conclusion

Game Theory is nothing but calculating probabilities and its implementation can be achieved easily using AI. It's a new field and researchers can study it, maybe it can ripe some surprising results. Moreover, Game Theory provides an extra edge for scholars to study AI from a different perspective. Perhaps, using Game Theory algorithms to train AI models be a perfect idea to unite GT and AI; this can be a topic on which one can carry out research.
